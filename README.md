# Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting unit sales for thousands of items sold across different stores of **Corporación Favorita**, a large grocery retailer in Ecuador.  
The goal is to build a machine learning model using **time-series forecasting** to more accurately predict sales, based on historical data, store/item information, and promotions.  

This is a "Getting Started" competition on Kaggle, designed for beginners to practice machine learning skills with real-world retail data.

## Goal of the Competition
- Forecast daily sales for multiple items across different stores.  
- Improve predictions compared to simple heuristic or manual forecasting.  
- Learn and apply time-series forecasting techniques in Python.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following CSV files:

- **holidays_events.csv**: Contains information about holidays and special events that may affect sales.  
- **oil.csv**: Daily oil prices, which may influence grocery sales indirectly.  
- **sample_submission.csv**: Example submission file showing the required format for predictions.  
- **stores.csv**: Information about each store, such as type and location.  
- **train.csv**: Training dataset with historical sales, including dates, store, item, promotions, and unit sales.  
- **test.csv**: Test dataset for which you need to predict sales.  
- **transactions.csv**: Daily number of transactions per store.

> Place all CSV files in the `data/` folder of the project.
